# Background traffic generator for the NetWatch Dense demo recording.
#
# Dense puts a mirrored throughput graph at the top — download growing up from
# the time axis, upload growing down from it — over a connection table sorted
# by rate. That needs a different shape of traffic from the Lite demo:
#
#   - SEVERAL DISTINCT HOSTS, so the connection table has rows worth reading
#     and the sort order means something. One host hammered repeatedly is one
#     row.
#   - STAGGERED RATES, so the table sorts into a visibly different order
#     instead of four rows reading the same number.
#   - AN UPLOAD STREAM. This is the one the Lite generator doesn't need. A
#     download-only workload leaves the mirrored graph's lower half flat, which
#     records the headline feature as half a graph. Browsing really is
#     asymmetric — that asymmetry is the thing the mirror exists to show — but
#     a flat line shows it less well than a small one.
#   - LONG-LIVED FLOWS. Short bursts finish between connection snapshots and
#     the rows flicker in and out, so every stream is rate-limited to outlast
#     the recording, and restarts give netwatch fresh ClientHellos to read the
#     SNI from partway through.
#
# The REMOTE column shows that SNI when the handshake was captured, so start
# this AFTER netwatch is already capturing or the column reads back raw IPs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/demo-dense-traffic.sh     # runs until killed
#   pkill -f demo-dense-traffic.sh
set -uo pipefail

# url|rate — distinct hosts, each large enough to outlast the recording.
# Rates are high enough that the aggregate dominates whatever else the machine
# is doing. The plot's ceiling is the window's peak, so a background burst from
# an unrelated process sets the scale and squashes the demo's own traffic into
# the bottom of the box — more streams, running harder, make the aggregate both
# larger and steadier than any one interloper.

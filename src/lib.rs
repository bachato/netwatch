// Clippy lints deliberately allowed crate-wide. Each is a decision, not an
// oversight — the alternative clippy suggests is worse for this codebase, and
// leaving them as warnings meant the real signal was buried in noise nobody
// read. With these declared, `-D warnings` becomes a gate CI can actually
// enforce.
//
// `collapsible_match` — collapsing `Arm => { if cond { .. } }` into
// `Arm if cond => { .. }` moves the condition into a match guard, and both
// places it fires are places that must not happen:
//
//   * `event.rs` would put a channel `send()` — a side effect — inside a
//     pattern guard.
//   * `app.rs` is a several-thousand-line ordered keyboard match. A guarded
//     arm falls through when the guard fails, so collapsing changes which
//     later arm receives the key. That exact failure has already bitten this
//     file once; see the ordering comment above the Egress `x` handler.
//
// Clippy's own autofix demonstrated the risk: applied blindly it produced a
// non-exhaustive match in `dns_cache.rs` and failed to compile.
//
// `too_many_arguments` — nine rendering and collection functions take 8–14
// parameters. Bundling them into structs would add a type per call site and
// change nothing about behaviour or clarity; a draw function that needs eight
// pieces of state is not improved by hiding that fact.
//
// `vec_init_then_push` — the two help-screen builders push ~100 lines each,
// interleaved with conditionals and section comments. Folding the leading run
// into `vec![]` would leave one function built two different ways.

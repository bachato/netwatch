//! Finding Npcap's `wpcap.dll` at startup on Windows.
//!
//! Npcap 1.x installs its DLLs into `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap\` rather than
//! `System32` itself, so it can sit beside a WinPcap install instead of
//! replacing it. That subdirectory is **not** on the loader's default search
//! path, so a binary importing `wpcap.dll` by name doesn't find it: the process
//! dies before `main()` runs and Windows shows a bare "wpcap.dll was not found"
//! message box (issue #47). The installer's *Install Npcap in WinPcap
//! API-compatible Mode* option also copies the DLLs into `System32`, which is
//! why the same machine works after reinstalling with that box ticked — but it
//! is unchecked by default, so the default install is the one that fails.
//!
//! The fix is the one Wireshark and nmap use for the same layout: tell the
//! loader where Npcap lives, then load `wpcap.dll` ourselves before any capture
//! code needs it. `build.rs` marks the wpcap imports delay-loaded so nothing
//! resolves them at process start, which leaves a window in `main()` to do this
//! — and to fail with a sentence a user can act on instead of a modal.
//!
//! Setting the directory also covers `Packet.dll`, which `wpcap.dll` imports
//! and which lives beside it: the loader searches the `SetDllDirectoryW`
//! directory when resolving a dependency, and would otherwise miss it too.

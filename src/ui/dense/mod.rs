//! NetWatch Dense — the high-density single-screen view.
//!
//! Four boxes tiling 130×44 with **no header bar, no menu bar and no status
//! bar**: identity, uptime, sort state, page range and every keybind live
//! inside the box borders, so all 44 rows carry content. The counterpart to
//! [`crate::ui::lite`], which spends its 80×24 answering one question — this
//! spends a big terminal showing everything at once.
//!
//! The networking-specific move is the **mirrored dual graph**: download grows
//! up from a centre axis, upload grows down from it, sharing one time scale.
//! Traffic symmetry becomes a shape you recognise instantly — a download burst
//! is a cliff above the line, a backup job is a cliff below it.
//!
//! Entered from the settings menu (`View`), by cycling with `V`, or with
//! `--view dense`. Opt-in only: the full tabbed TUI stays the default at every
//! terminal size, and nothing here changes what the other views show.
//!
//! ## The grid is authoritative
//!
//! Every constant below is transcribed from the design handoff
//! (`design_handoff_netwatch_2`, revised) and the tests at the bottom lock it:
//! columns must tile without overlapping, headers must sit over their own
//! data, and no graph or meter may run under the label that reads it. The
//! reference implementation shipped with a header 12 columns adrift of its
//! values and two meters painting under their own readouts; the invariant
//! tests exist so that class of drift cannot land here silently.
//!
//! Below 130×44 the view degrades to a 80×24 compact layout (the `ifaces` and
//! `health` boxes drop, the graphs halve); below that, to a too-small notice.
//! Degrading never scrolls horizontally and never moves a box that stayed.

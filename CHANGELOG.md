# Changelog

All notable changes to NetWatch will be documented in this file.

## [0.15.9] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **`cargo install netwatch-tui` now ships eBPF too** — bumped the `netwatch-sdk` dep to 0.1.2, which carries a pre-built `netwatch_sdk_ebpf.o` (2424-byte eBPF ELF) directly in the published crate. The SDK's `build.rs` embeds it via `include_bytes!` automatically, so any Linux build picks it up without needing nightly Rust + bpf-linker + LLVM 18 on the consumer side. Closes the remaining gap from v0.15.8 where only `brew install` and direct tarball downloads got eBPF.
- **Release workflow simplified** — dropped the now-redundant "Build netwatch-sdk eBPF object" + `[patch.crates-io]` step. The Linux release tarballs still get the same BPF object, but via the published SDK instead of an in-workflow clone-and-build.

## [0.15.8] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Linux release tarballs now ship with the eBPF BPF object embedded** — the v0.15.6 attempt failed because netwatch-sdk's `crates/ebpf-programs/rust-toolchain.toml` listed `bpfel-unknown-none` as a target, making rustup try to download `rust-std` for a tier-3 target that has no precompiled artifact. SDK fix landed at netwatch-sdk@48f8960; netwatch's release workflow re-enables the BPF build step (clone SDK, install bpf-linker, run `scripts/build-ebpf.sh`, then `[patch.crates-io]`-override the SDK so cargo build picks up the local copy with the BPF object embedded). Linux users downloading the tarball or installing via Homebrew now get kernel-attributed PIDs out of the box; `cargo install netwatch-tui` users still fall back to lsof until the SDK starts shipping the pre-built `.o` on crates.io directly.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **v0.15.6 release was broken** — the new "Build netwatch-sdk eBPF object" step in the release workflow tried to install the SDK's pinned nightly (`nightly-2026-01-15`) but rustup couldn't fetch `rust-std` for `bpfel-unknown-none` on that date (intermittent nightly-channel coverage gap). The first Linux build job failed and `fail-fast` cancelled everything else, so no v0.15.6 binaries shipped. v0.15.7 reverts the workflow's BPF build step; Linux release tarballs ship with the `ebpf` feature compiled in but the BPF object missing, so `EventSource::new` returns `BpfObjectMissing` at runtime and netwatch falls back to lsof/ss attribution. macOS PKTAP is unaffected. The actual BPF-shipping fix is now blocked on bumping the SDK's pinned nightly (and ideally the SDK starts shipping the pre-built `.o` on crates.io directly).

## [0.15.6] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Kernel-level Linux process attribution via netwatch-sdk eBPF** — On Linux, netwatch now loads a `tcp_v4_connect` kprobe (via [`netwatch-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/netwatch-sdk) Phase 1) that captures `(pid, comm, src/dst, dst_port)` for every outbound TCP connect at kernel time. The Connections collector overlays those attributions onto rows from `ss`/`lsof` polling — same shape as the macOS PKTAP integration — which catches sub-2-second flows that polling misses and reports the actual *thread* `comm` rather than the parent binary's name. The Connections header now shows `attribution: ebpf` (green) when the kprobe is loaded or `attribution: lsof — ebpf unavailable: …` (warn) with the specific reason when it fell back; the per-row bullet glyph swaps to `◉` for kernel-attributed rows. Requires `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_PERFMON` (or root) and kernel ≥ 5.10. The Linux release tarballs ship with the BPF object pre-embedded (the release workflow runs the SDK's `scripts/build-ebpf.sh` and builds netwatch against a `[patch.crates-io]` override that picks up the artifact). For `cargo install netwatch-tui` users on Linux, eBPF currently falls back to `BpfObjectMissing` until the SDK starts shipping the BPF object on crates.io directly — a separate piece of work.

### Changed
- The `ebpf` feature is now on by default. Builds gracefully fall back to lsof/ss attribution when the platform can't load eBPF — non-Linux hosts (returns `UnsupportedPlatform`), missing capabilities, kernel < 5.10, or the BPF object isn't embedded. macOS continues to use PKTAP for its kernel-attribution path; both sources flip `Connection.attribution` so the renderer can flag them uniformly.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Reliable QUIC SNI extraction (RFC 9001 + RFC 9369)** — The Packets tab now decrypts QUIC v1 and v2 Initial packets per the spec and surfaces the embedded TLS ClientHello's `server_name` extension on the row. Previously netwatch had a heuristic that scanned the Initial payload for a cleartext ClientHello pattern, which doesn't work because real Initials are AEAD-protected with keys derived from the Destination Connection ID; that heuristic always returned `—` on real-world traffic. The new implementation does the full HKDF-Expand-Label key derivation, AES-128 header protection removal (via `ring::aead::quic`), AES-128-GCM payload decryption, and CRYPTO frame reassembly. Verified against RFC 9001 Appendix A.1 (key derivation byte-match) and Appendix A.2 (full sample packet → `example.com` SNI). Lives in the new `src/collectors/quic.rs` module; `ring 0.17` promoted from transitive to direct dep.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Second memory-leak source for non-sudo Linux runs** — `TrafficCollector::interfaces()` was deep-cloning the full per-interface state (including each interface's two 600-sample history `VecDeque`s) on every call, ~96 KB per call on a 10-interface host. The Dashboard alone hit it 4 times per render and `App::tick()` another 6, totalling ~10 calls/sec ≈ 1 MB/sec of allocation churn. On Linux, glibc's per-thread arena retention turns that churn into climbing RSS even though no logical leak exists in the data structures. The accessor now returns `Arc<Vec<InterfaceTraffic>>` and `update()` swaps in a fresh `Arc` each tick — reads are a single atomic refcount bump regardless of interface count or history depth. `har5ha` reported continued RSS climb on v0.15.3 (~115 MB after 90 min on Dashboard-only); this addresses the source the v0.15.1 packet-pipeline fix couldn't reach because pcap is dormant without root. Reported in #27.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Kernel-level process attribution on macOS via PKTAP** — netwatch now opens xnu's `pktap` pseudo-device alongside the regular packet capture (when running with sudo) and harvests `(pid, comm, direction)` straight from the kernel for every captured frame. The Connections, Dashboard, Topology, Timeline, and Insights tabs all consume this attribution, so short-lived flows that close inside one lsof poll window — `curl` to a CDN, a DNS query, an mDNS announcement — now show the real owning process instead of `—`. Threaded processes whose `comm` differs from the parent get the actual thread name rather than the parent binary's. Falls back to the existing lsof/ss/netstat polling path when PKTAP can't be opened (no root, non-Apple libpcap, kernel feature missing); attribution source is tracked per-row via a new `AttributionSource` enum (`Lsof` default, `Pktap` after kernel overlay).
- **`pktap_probe` example** — `sudo cargo run --example pktap_probe` prints attributed events as they arrive, useful for confirming PKTAP works on a given macOS build before turning on the full TUI.

### Fixed
- **PKTAP attribution on macOS 15+** — Apple renamed the libpcap symbol used to enable per-packet metadata: macOS 14 and earlier exported `pcap_set_want_pktap_pktmetadata`, macOS 15 dropped that and exports the shorter `pcap_set_want_pktap` instead. The dlsym lookup now probes both names so the same build picks up attribution across older and newer macOS without a recompile. Surfaced when the probe failed with `pcap_set_want_pktap_pktmetadata not found` on macOS 15.4.1.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **Refresh-rate setting now hot-reloads** — Changing `Refresh Rate (ms)` in the Settings popup used to require a restart because `EventHandler` captured `tick_rate` once at construction. The polling thread now re-reads an `Arc<AtomicU64>` each iteration and a saved change takes effect on the next poll cycle.
- **Filter-aware connection selection (#26)** — Under an active connection filter, `PgDn`-to-bottom left `connection_scroll` clamped against the *unfiltered* list while the table rendered the filtered list, so subsequent `UpArrow` looked stuck and mouse clicks on visible rows did nothing. All five clamp/select sites (PgDn, mouse click, `W`/`T`/`Enter` action handlers) now route through `connections::filtered_sorted_conns(app)` so the rendered view drives selection bounds.

### Changed
- **Dots graph style narrower per-sample** — One filled sub-column per sample window instead of both, with the area-fill below each sample's peak preserved. Gives the classic btop "comb" look with visible gaps between samples.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Memory leak under sustained packet capture** — `StreamTracker` retained every unique flow for the lifetime of the process, and the per-IP `rtt_history` map plus the `rtt_sampled_streams` set grew without bound alongside it. On a busy host this drove RSS into the 1 GB+ range after roughly an hour. Stream storage is now an LRU map capped at 1024 flows (with a 256-entry watermark), `rtt_history` keys are bounded to 256 remote IPs (FIFO eviction), and the sampled-streams set self-prunes against the live tracker on every visit. The per-tick deep-clone of all streams in the RTT sampler is also gone, replaced with an in-place visitor. Reported in #27.
- **`g` toggle on the Connections tab now actually shows GeoIP** — `app.show_geo` was wired to the keybinding but only the Packets tab read it. Connections now renders a `GEO` column (country code plus city when available) between REMOTE and STATE while the toggle is on. Reported in #27.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Selectable graph styles** — A new `Graph Style` setting (Settings → ←/→) cycles between `bars` (the existing solid-color stacked-block sparkline) and `dots` (a btop-style braille pixel-fill that gives 4× vertical resolution per cell). Persists to `~/.config/netwatch/config.toml` alongside the theme. Applies to every chart in the app — dashboard throughput, interface detail chart, top-connections row sparklines, RTT history, processes RX, stats throughput, and the timeline activity strip.

### Changed
- **All sparklines route through a single `graph::render` helper** — Per-call-site `Sparkline::default().data().style()` is replaced with `crate::graph::render(...)`. The timeline's three-color severity overlay shares a y-axis via `graph::render_with_max(...)` so layers stay aligned regardless of style. `dots` skips zero samples so flat-zero spans render nothing instead of a baseline floor — keeps stacked overlays clean.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-29

Re-spin of v0.14.0 to correct version metadata. The v0.14.0 commit on
the tag was missing the Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock bump and CHANGELOG entry
(staging mistake), so the binaries shipped under v0.14.0 reported
themselves as `0.14.0-rc.3` internally and `cargo publish` rejected the
duplicate. v0.14.1 ships the same feature set with consistent version
metadata across all release channels.

No code changes vs. the intended v0.14.0 — the whole "what's new"
section below applied to that release and applies here.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Topology view, redesigned** — Local addresses (this host + LAN peers) anchor the left side of the graph, public Internet peers on the right, with ROUTER → ISP as the spine in the middle. Each spine box has a colored health dot pinned to its trunk so router/ISP status is visible at a glance. PR #24.
- **Auto-traceroute on launch** — A one-shot traceroute to `1.1.1.1` is kicked at startup so the ISP gateway hop populates the topology view without requiring the user to press T. Manual `T` against the selected remote still works.
- **Real RTT and CPU on Processes tab** — Per-process kernel RTT (min across the process's TCP connections) and CPU% are now wired through to the Processes tab, with rolling history sparklines.
- **Timeline detectors** — Timeline flags RTT spikes and interface flap events as discrete activity entries.

### Changed
- **Whole-app design pass** — Dashboard, Connections, Interfaces, Packets, Stats, Topology, Processes, and Insights tabs reworked around the v0.14 design pack. Visual hierarchy, typography, and color usage are now consistent across tabs.
- **Throughput sparkline fills wide terminals** — Sparkline history was capped at 60 samples (60s @ 1Hz) but the chart could render ~94 cells on a 1200-px terminal, leaving ~36% empty space on the left. History is now capped at 600 samples (10 min). The throughput chart title reflects what's actually drawn (`last 60s` on narrow terminals, `last Nm` on wider ones).
- **Throughput KPI trend window stays short** — Even with the history extension, the KPI tile's trend arrow continues to compare only the most recent ~minute, so the arrow stays responsive instead of smoothing across the full 10 min.

### Notes
First non-RC tag in the 0.14 line. Stable `cargo install netwatch-tui` and `brew upgrade` will both pick this up; `0.14.0-rc.1`/`-rc.2`/`-rc.3` remain on crates.io for anyone pinning to a specific RC.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Per-tab sort picker** — Press `s` on Dashboard, Connections, Interfaces, or Processes to open a sort picker overlay. Navigate with `↑↓` or `j/k`, `Enter` to apply, `S` to toggle ascending/descending, `/` to filter columns by name, `Esc` or `s` to close. Each tab remembers its own sort state. Dashboard and Interfaces sort once at render so the sparkline and the table stay index-aligned. #20, #21
- **Comprehensive sort test coverage** — ~38 new tests covering per-tab sort integration, `cmp_ip_addr` (IPv4/IPv6/brackets/wildcards/port tiebreakers), `cmp_f64` (NaN-safe via `total_cmp`), case-insensitive comparators, picker cursor/filter edge cases, and meta-tests that fail CI if a new column is added without a matching comparator arm. #22
- **Vim-style navigation keys** — `j`/`k` alias `↓`/`↑` for list/stream/help/settings scrolling; `h`/`l` alias `←`/`→` for settings theme and default-tab selectors. Arrow keys continue to work unchanged. Stream view's existing `h` (toggle hex/text mode) is preserved. Fixes #18.

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Case-insensitive process-name sort in Connections** — The Connections tab's Process column now sorts case-insensitively, so `Finder`, `facetime`, and `kernel_task` interleave in dictionary order instead of splitting into two alphabetical runs. Case-only differences use byte-wise order as a deterministic tiebreaker. Fixes #16.

### Removed
- **Misleading `s:Sort` hint on Processes tab** — The hint was never wired up (the Processes tab is always sorted by total bandwidth descending via the bandwidth ranker) and is gone from the footer.

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Default Tab setting is now a cycler** — The "Default Tab" row in the Settings popup (`,`) now cycles through valid tabs with `←` / `→`, mirroring the Theme row. Previously it was a free-text field that required knowing (or guessing) the tab names, and the error hint listing valid values could get truncated at narrow terminal widths. Fixes #17.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Ocean theme — readable group-box borders** — In addition to muted text, group-box borders and separators now use the lighter `#B5B6B7` neutral so panel outlines stay legible on the `#224FBC` background.

### Reverted
- **Dashboard single-interface collapse** — The v0.12.2 behaviour that hid the Interfaces table on single-interface systems is reverted. In practice almost every machine has `lo0` and other virtual interfaces alongside the physical one, which are useful for diagnostics, so hiding the table was rarely correct.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Ocean theme — readable muted text** — `text_muted` in the Ocean theme is now a lighter neutral (#B5B6B7) so secondary labels (group headers, units, etc.) are legible against the `#224FBC` background. The previous value (Apple's bright-black slot, #818383) failed WCAG AA contrast.
- **Dashboard hides Interfaces panel when only one interface exists** — On single-interface systems, the Interfaces table collapses and Top Connections expands to fill the reclaimed space, showing more rows.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Ocean theme** — New color theme tuned for Terminal.app's "Ocean" profile (bg #224FBC). Uses Apple's default Terminal ANSI palette values for legibility on the deep blue background. Set `theme = "ocean"` in `~/.config/netwatch/config.toml` or switch via Settings (`,`).

### Changed
- **Integer byte/rate formatting** — Byte totals and transfer rates now display as integers (e.g. `42 MB/s` instead of `42.3 MB/s`). Decimals rarely contained significant signal and added visual noise.
- **Zero values render as `-`** — Empty rates and zero totals show a dash instead of `0 B` / `0 B/s`, reducing noise in tables where many rows are idle.
- **Right-aligned numeric columns** — Rate and byte columns in Dashboard, Interfaces, Processes, and Stats tabs are now right-aligned to fixed widths, so unit suffixes stay put across rows instead of jumping as values change.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Per-connection Down/Up column** — The Connections tab now shows live RX/TX rates per flow, sourced from the ambient packet capture. Sort by throughput with `s` to find the busy connection, then `Enter` to drill into its packets.
- **Ambient packet capture at launch** — NetWatch now starts capture automatically on startup (using the configured interface and BPF filter, if any). Connection rates are populated as packets arrive. If capture fails for lack of privileges, the app continues running with the Down/Up column blank.

### Changed
- **BPF filter is now config-only** — The `b` keybinding for live-editing the BPF capture filter on the Packets tab has been removed. Set a BPF filter in Settings (`,`) → BPF Filter if you need one; it applies at launch. The display filter (`/`) is unaffected.
- **Disk metrics exclude macOS internal mounts** — Remote disk metrics now skip `/Volumes/`, `/System/Volumes/`, and `/private/` mounts so APFS firmlinks no longer appear as duplicate rows.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Processes tab empty on Linux** — Linux `ss` outputs `ESTAB` instead of `ESTABLISHED`, causing the processes and top connections tabs to show zero entries. The parser now normalizes the state at parse time.
- **Windows UI responsiveness** — Moved interface stat collection to a background thread so key bindings no longer block for 5–30 seconds on Windows.
- **Atomic ordering** — Relaxed traffic collector busy-flag from `SeqCst` to `Acquire`/`Release`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **AI Insights tab** — Restored as an opt-in feature (off by default). Enable in Settings (`,`) → AI Insights: on. Analyzes live packet data and network state every 15 seconds and surfaces security concerns, performance issues, and anomalies as bullet-point summaries.
- **Configurable AI endpoint** — Supports local Ollama (`local`, default) and any remote endpoint (Ollama Cloud or custom proxy) via the AI Endpoint setting. Point it at a cloud URL to skip local model setup entirely.
- **AI settings in the Settings overlay** — Three new settings: AI Insights (on/off), AI Model (default: `llama3.2`), AI Endpoint (`local` or a full base URL). Changes apply live without restart.

### Changed
- **Tab count** — Tab [9] Insights appears in the header only when AI Insights is enabled. The zero-config experience for users who don't enable it is unchanged.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Flight Recorder** — Rolling 5-minute incident capture that records packets, connections, health snapshots, DNS analytics, bandwidth context, and network-intel alerts.
- **Incident bundle export** — `Shift+E` exports a bundle containing `summary.md`, `packets.pcap`, `connections.json`, `health.json`, `bandwidth.json`, `dns.json`, `alerts.json`, and `manifest.json`.
- **Manual and automatic freeze** — `Shift+F` freezes the current incident window, and critical network-intel alerts now auto-freeze an armed recorder so transient failures are preserved.

### Changed
- **Global recorder status in header** — NetWatch now shows `REC 5m` while armed and `FROZEN` after a capture window is locked.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-30

### Removed
- **AI Insights tab** — Removed the Ollama-dependent Insights tab. NetWatch is a sharp network tool, not an AI wrapper. The tab required external setup (Ollama + model download) that broke the zero-config promise for 95% of users.

### Changed
- **Tab count reduced from 9 to 8** — Cleaner navigation: Dashboard (1), Connections (2), Interfaces (3), Packets (4), Stats (5), Topology (6), Timeline (7), Processes (8).
- **README rewritten** — Shorter, sharper, sells the product. Install instructions above the fold. Detailed keybindings collapsed. Platform badge is honest (macOS + Linux only).
- **Hardened error handling** — Fixed `unwrap()` calls in production code paths to prevent panics on unexpected input.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Processes tab** — Per-process bandwidth ranking with RX/TX rates, connection counts, and totals
- **JSON/CSV export** — Export connection data from the Connections tab
- **CI/CD pipeline** — GitHub Actions with cross-compilation for Linux (x86_64/aarch64), macOS (x86_64/aarch64), and Windows
- **Homebrew formula** — `brew install matthart1983/tap/netwatch`
- **Clippy + fmt enforcement** in CI

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **AI Network Insights** — Ollama integration with auto-analysis every 15s
- **Connection Timeline** — Gantt-style connection lifetime visualization
- **Network Topology** — ASCII network map with health indicators
- **Traceroute** — Built-in hop-by-hop traceroute from Topology or Connections
- **Network Intelligence** — Port scan detection, beaconing detection, DNS tunnel detection
- **TCP handshake timing** — SYN→SYN-ACK→ACK latency measurement
- **Handshake histogram** — Latency distribution in Stats tab
- **Display filters** — Wireshark-style filter syntax with combinators
- **BPF capture filters** — Applied at capture time for efficient filtering
- **Stream reassembly** — TCP/UDP conversation view with text and hex modes
- **Expert info & coloring** — Automatic severity classification
- **Packet bookmarks** — Mark and jump between packets of interest
- **PCAP export** — Save captures to standard .pcap files
- **Protocol statistics** — Protocol hierarchy table
- **5 color themes** — Dark, Light, Solarized, Dracula, Nord with instant switching
- **Settings menu** — Live configuration editing with TOML persistence
- **Mouse support** — Clickable tabs, scroll wheel, row selection
- **GeoIP** — Online + offline MaxMind .mmdb support
- **Whois/RDAP** — On-demand IP lookup
- **Latency sparklines** — Per-connection RTT trend visualization

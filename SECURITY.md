# Security Policy

NetWatch is a network diagnostics tool that typically runs with elevated
privileges and parses hostile input (live packet captures) by design. Security
reports are taken seriously and handled as the highest-priority work.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

- Preferred: [**GitHub private vulnerability reporting**](https://github.com/matthart1983/netwatch/security/advisories/new)
  ("Report a vulnerability" under the Security tab).
- Alternatively: email **matthew.t.hartley@gmail.com** with `[netwatch security]`
  in the subject.

You'll get an acknowledgement within **72 hours** and a triage verdict within
**7 days**. Fixes for confirmed vulnerabilities ship as a patch release as soon
as they're ready — NetWatch is independently maintained, so severe reports jump
every queue. Please give us a reasonable window to ship a fix before public
disclosure; we're happy to coordinate timing and will credit you in the
advisory and release notes (or keep you anonymous, your call).

## Supported versions

NetWatch is pre-1.0. Security fixes target the **latest release** only —
please reproduce on the current version before reporting.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| latest release | ✅ |
| anything older | ❌ upgrade first |

## Scope — what we care about most

NetWatch's threat model assumes packets on the wire are attacker-controlled,
and that the tool often runs as root. In rough priority order:

1. **Privilege escalation** — anything that lets an unprivileged local user
   leverage NetWatch's elevated capture/eBPF privileges.
2. **Sandbox escape** — on Linux, NetWatch applies a post-startup Landlock
   sandbox; bypasses of it (or of `--sandbox-strict`) are in scope.
3. **Hostile-input handling** — crashes, hangs, or memory unsafety in the
   packet, DPI, TLS/QUIC, DNS, or HTTP parsers when fed malicious traffic.
   (Parser *panics* on hostile input are security bugs here, not ordinary
   crashes — they're a remote DoS against a monitoring tool.)
4. **Sensitive-data mishandling** — TLS session keys from a keylog file,
   captured payloads, or incident-bundle/flight-recorder exports ending up
   somewhere unexpected (world-readable files, logs, remote streaming).
5. **Daemon/remote mode** — API-key handling and anything reachable from the
   network when running `netwatch daemon` with `--remote` or `--metrics-addr`.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in dependencies with no NetWatch-specific
exploit path (report upstream, though a heads-up is welcome), issues requiring
an already-root attacker, and self-inflicted configurations (e.g. exposing the
metrics endpoint to the internet deliberately).

## Hardening notes for operators

- Run with the sandbox on (default). `--sandbox-strict` refuses to start if it
  can't be enforced.
- Treat TLS keylog files and exported incident bundles as secrets — they can
  contain decrypted traffic.
- `netwatch daemon` metrics bind to `127.0.0.1` by default; keep it that way
  unless you have a reason not to.
